This simple script will crawl through all the AWS regions and check for the EBS Volumes which are not being attached or used within the last 30 days or more. Since the Cloudtrail event logs are being used to determine the activity data of a certain Volume, the earliest data we can collect is 90 days. If the cloudtrail logs do not return anything, it means last activity happened more than 90 days ago.
